Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and promising areas for AI in healthcare. There are constant new developments, and here are some of the most significant recent trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a major area. Instead of just screening existing databases, AI, particularly generative models (like GANs and VAEs), can now design entirely new molecules from scratch with desired properties. They can learn the \"rules\" of chemistry and biology to create compounds that are optimized for binding to specific targets, improved solubility, or reduced toxicity.\n*   **Targeted Property Optimization:** Generative AI can be used to not only design a molecule but also to fine-tune specific properties. For example, an AI could be tasked with designing a molecule that binds strongly to a cancer protein *and* has good oral bioavailability.\n\n**2. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** AI is getting better at sifting through massive amounts of biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, electronic health records) to identify novel disease targets that were previously unknown or difficult to find.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can help assess whether a newly identified target is actually \"druggable\" – meaning, can a small molecule or biologic effectively interact with it to produce a therapeutic effect.\n\n**3. Enhancing Preclinical Research:**\n\n*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are being trained to predict how well a drug candidate will work in animal models and in humans, as well as its potential toxic side effects, before expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments. This can significantly reduce the number of failures in later stages.\n*   **Automated Literature Review and Hypothesis Generation:** AI can rapidly scan and synthesize vast amounts of scientific literature, identifying connections and generating novel hypotheses that human researchers might miss.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Patient Selection:**\n\n*   **\"Digital Twins\" for Drug Testing:** While still in early stages, the concept of creating digital representations of patients to test drug efficacy and predict responses is being explored with AI.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI is crucial for identifying biomarkers that can predict a patient's response to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and effective clinical trials and personalized medicine.\n*   **Optimizing Trial Parameters:** AI can analyze historical trial data to suggest optimal dosage, trial duration, and patient inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\n**5. AI for Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze the molecular structures and known mechanisms of action of existing approved drugs to identify potential new therapeutic uses for different diseases. This is a faster and often cheaper route than developing entirely new drugs.\n\n**Examples of Recent Progress/Companies in the News:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** This company has been very vocal about its AI-driven drug discovery platform, which has progressed drug candidates from discovery to clinical trials in remarkably short timeframes. They've had several AI-designed molecules enter human trials.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** They use AI and automation to map cellular changes and identify new drug candidates for rare diseases and other conditions.\n*   **Atomwise:** Focuses on using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery, predicting how well molecules will bind to target proteins.\n*   **Exscientia:** Another prominent player that uses AI to design and discover drug candidates, aiming to deliver new medicines faster.\n*   **Big Pharma Collaborations:** Many major pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca) are actively partnering with AI drug discovery startups or building their own internal AI capabilities.\n\n**Key Trends to Watch:**\n\n*   **Increased Speed and Efficiency:** The overarching goal is to drastically cut down the time and cost of drug discovery, which traditionally takes over a decade and billions of dollars.\n*   **Focus on Undruggable Targets:** AI is opening up possibilities for tackling diseases that were previously considered too difficult to treat due to the lack of suitable drug targets.\n*   **Personalized Drug Development:** Tailoring drugs to individual patient profiles based on their genetic makeup and disease characteristics.\n*   **AI for Biologics:** While much attention is on small molecules, AI is also being applied to the discovery and design of protein-based therapies (biologics).\n\nThe field is incredibly exciting, and the impact of AI on bringing new, more effective treatments to patients faster is already becoming a reality.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **Accelerated Target Identification and Validation**. This is a crucial step because before you can even start thinking about designing a drug, you need to know *what* to target within the body that is causing or contributing to a disease.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this means and why AI is so transformative in this area:\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Complexity of Biology:** Biological systems are incredibly complex. Understanding the precise molecular pathways involved in a disease is a monumental task.\n*   **Vast Amounts of Data:** Researchers are generating enormous datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and clinical studies. Manually sifting through and making sense of all this data to find meaningful connections is incredibly difficult and time-consuming.\n*   **Hypothesis-Driven Approach:** Historically, target identification has often been driven by existing hypotheses. If a hypothesis turned out to be wrong, researchers would have to go back to square one.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many proteins or pathways involved in disease have been considered \"undruggable\" because we didn't fully understand their role or how to interact with them.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n1.  **Uncovering Novel Disease Pathways:**\n    *   **Pattern Recognition in Big Data:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excel at identifying subtle patterns and correlations within massive, heterogeneous datasets that human eyes (or traditional statistical methods) would miss.\n    *   **Unsupervised Learning:** AI can discover new relationships and pathways without being told what to look for, essentially uncovering hidden biological mechanisms driving disease.\n    *   **Integration of Multi-Omics Data:** AI can effectively integrate data from different \"omics\" layers (genomics, proteomics, etc.) to provide a more holistic view of disease biology and identify key molecular players.\n\n2.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **Learning from Existing Drugs:** AI models can be trained on data from known drugs and their targets. They learn what makes a protein a good target (e.g., accessible binding sites, involvement in critical pathways).\n    *   **Scoring Potential Targets:** Once a potential target is identified through data analysis, AI can then score its \"druggability\" – predicting the likelihood that a small molecule or antibody could effectively bind to and modulate its activity. This helps prioritize targets that are more likely to lead to successful drug development.\n    *   **Identifying Structural Features:** AI can analyze protein structures to identify specific pockets or regions where a drug molecule could bind, guiding initial drug design efforts.\n\n3.  **Prioritizing Targets for Intervention:**\n    *   **Ranking by Disease Relevance:** AI can rank potential targets based on their inferred role in disease progression, patient outcomes, and their potential impact on the disease.\n    *   **Reducing False Positives:** By analyzing multiple data sources and types, AI can help reduce the number of false positive targets, saving researchers time and resources.\n\n4.  **Accelerating Validation:**\n    *   **Hypothesis Generation and Testing:** AI can not only suggest targets but also generate hypotheses about how modulating that target might affect the disease. This can then be tested experimentally more efficiently.\n    *   **Predicting Outcomes of Genetic Perturbations:** AI can help predict the likely outcomes of knocking out or activating a gene (e.g., using CRISPR), providing experimental guidance.\n\n**Examples of AI in Action for Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Companies analyzing patient genomic data:** Identifying specific gene mutations or expression patterns that correlate with disease severity or treatment response, and then pinpointing the proteins encoded by those genes as potential targets.\n*   **AI analyzing protein-protein interaction networks:** Discovering key nodes in these networks that, when disrupted, can influence disease pathways.\n*   **AI sifting through literature and databases:** Identifying underappreciated links between biological pathways and diseases that might suggest novel targets.\n\n**Why is this so impactful?**\n\n*   **Faster Time to Market:** Identifying the right target is the very first step. Accelerating this process inherently speeds up the entire drug discovery pipeline.\n*   **Tackling \"Undruggable\" Diseases:** AI's ability to analyze complex biology and uncover novel relationships is key to developing treatments for diseases where traditional approaches have failed.\n*   **More Precise and Personalized Therapies:** By understanding the specific molecular drivers of a disease in certain patient populations, AI can help identify targets for highly personalized treatments.\n\nIn essence, AI is transforming target identification from a laborious, often serendipitous process into a more systematic, data-driven, and efficient endeavor. It's about using the power of computation to decode the intricate language of biology and pinpoint the most promising points of intervention for new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven target identification and validation is diverse, ranging from large pharmaceutical giants with internal AI divisions to specialized AI-first biotech startups.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
